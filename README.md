## Week 1: Introduction to Web Development
#### To start of the semester, the difference between front-end and back-end developers. Some examples are learning the use of HTML,CSS and JavaScript which are the 3 core pillars of frontend development. To go slightly more in depth, I have learnt how they can change how the website look and the website interactivity uniquely. To end of my lesson I have learnt the structure of HTML documents, some elements such as heading, paragraph, image and lists tags and many more. With all this I created my first webpage which shows a guide on how to make a banana smoothie.
